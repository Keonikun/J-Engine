# J-Engine

### A Webgl Game-Engine

This game engine is programmed in THREE.js. It attempts to add the most basic features
of a standard game engine, while also keeping backwards compatability in mind. My goal
is to make this engine work on devices that are 10 years old. The engine is currently
in heavy development, however you are more than welcome to install it and use it to make
your own games.
